# Scary Maze Game

Welcome to the Scary Maze Game!

The objective of the Scary Maze Game is to navigate your character with mouse and keyboard controls to get to the other end of the maze before the alloted amount of three lives and time you have runs out. There are three levels with different mazes to get through, which each get progressively harder. As you progress through the levels, there will be extra time added on from considering the added difficulty. 

There are two ways to navigate your character through the maze. One way is to use the direction keys - up, left, right, and down to move the character slightly and accordingly. The other way is to click the mouse and drag it to drag the character through the maze. Movement through the maze must be done with the character remaining in the maze AT ALL TIMES, and within the allotted time limit. 

In the context of the time limit - there will be a displayed prompt to prompt you to press the character to go through the level if your mouse isn't pressed on it. That will help you stay focused to complete the level faster and with less hesitation.

A life will be lost if the character goes out of the maze, taking away from your total of three lives. You will have a total of three lives to get through all three levels in this maze game. If you run out of lives, the game will end - and you will be taken back to the beginning of the game - the home screen. The allotted time limit also must be noted along with the requirement to stay within the maze. If you fail to complete the maze successfully with your character within the allotted time limit, the game will end abruptly and you will be taken back to the beginning. The timer and set amount of three lives will be resetted with the restart of the game.

To progress through the three levels in this game, you must get to the end of the maze successfully. It will be distinctly marked in a specific colour - different from the maze colour. To win the game, you must complete all three levels in a row successfully while following the rules to stay within the maze and the allotted time limit for each level.

Good luck!
